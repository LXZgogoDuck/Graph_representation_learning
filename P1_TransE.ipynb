    "# Introduction\n",
    "Welcome to the first practical for Graph Representation Learning. In this practical, we will be covering the content of the lectures about TransE.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be using [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/index.html) to implement TransE from scratch, building it up piece by piece.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main goal of this practical is to create a working implementation of TransE. There are also two optional parts: *filtered negative sampling* and *RotatE*.\n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook is divided into sections, each of which comes with complete or partially completed code. Before each snippet of code there will be a description of what we are about to implement. The sections of code you need to complete are marked as **Tasks**. The majority of the length of this practical comes from code already written for you, so don't panic at the apparent length! There are only 8 tasks for you to complete.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please ensure that you operate within the framework given in the notebook and bring any questions you may have to the practical demonstrators. We suggest that you **DO NOT** edit code that is a part of the framework, since this will make it more difficult for demonstrators to assist if your code is broken.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we are working in a Jupyter Notebook, the code is very interactive. When you're stuck on something, try adding a new block of code below what you're working on and using it to debug your code. If you are new to Jupyter Notebooks, see [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inN8seMm7UI&ab_channel=TensorFlow) for a brief introduction video. If you are using Google Colab (which we recommend doing), please ensure you have changed the runtime type to use a GPU, as it will make your code run much faster."
