# Graph representation learning
This repository contains practical mini-projects for GRL.
## Practical 1
Aim to create a working implementation of TransE. There are also two parts: *filtered negative sampling* and *RotatE*.
## Practical 2
Implement the base graph neural network model from scratch (without using PyTorch Geometric), and prepare it for node classification.
## Practical 3
First implement two functions from scratch: **Graph Mini-Batching** and **Global Pooling**. Then, incorporate these two functions into a graph neural network model to solve a **Graph Classification** task
## Practical 4
Aim to investigate oversmoothing: we will consider different number of layers and visualise the corresponding node embeddings. Specifically, we will implement Graph Convolutional Network with skip connections jumping knowledge connections with Dimensionality reduction method: T-SNE.
## Practical 5
Create a working implementation of the 1-WL hash algorithm and understand its applicability and limitations.
